## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Welcome!

Welcome, and thank you for choosing to help contribute to Yet Another Module Organiser/ Manager!
Yet Another Module Organizer and Manager (YAMOM) is an all-in-one desktop app featuring 
a full course catalogue, module search and timetable builder for the National University of Singapore, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface.

This document intends to onboard developers onto YAMOM. We hope to bring you in to fix bugs, or even adding 
new features and dimensions to YAMOM!
It gives insights on how the project is set up, the architecture used, 
and the code style one should adopt when contributing to the project.


## 2. Setting up

This section describes the development tools used in the creation of YAMOM.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

1. **JDK** 11
2. **IntelliJ** IDEA
3. **Gradle** 6.2

### 2.2. Setting up the project locally

1. **Fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click **`File`** > **`Close Project`** to close the existing project dialog first).
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle  
   a.To set up the correct project structure **`Configure`** > **`Project Defaults`** > **`Project Structure`**  
   b. Under **`New...`** find the directory of the appropriate JDK version.
4. Click **`Import Project`**.
5. Find the **`build.gradle`** file and select it. Click **`OK`**.
6. Click **`Open as Project`**.
7. Click **`OK`** and accept the default settings.

### 2.3. Configure the coding style

In IntelliJ's IDEA we adopt [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html)
to set up IDEAâ€™s coding style to match ours.

>Optionally, you can follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html)
>to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems as you write code.



## 3. Design
