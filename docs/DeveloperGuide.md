## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Welcome!

Welcome, and thank you for choosing to help contribute to Yet Another Module Organiser/ Manager!
Yet Another Module Organizer and Manager (YAMOM) is an all-in-one desktop app featuring
a full course catalogue, module search and timetable builder for the National University of Singapore, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface.

This document intends to onboard developers onto YAMOM. We hope to bring you in to fix bugs, or even adding
new features and dimensions to YAMOM!
It gives insights on how the project is set up, the architecture used,
and the code style one should adopt when contributing to the project.

## 2. Setting up

This section describes the development tools used in the creation of YAMOM.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

1. **JDK** 11
2. **IntelliJ** IDEA
3. **Gradle** 6.2

### 2.2. Setting up the project locally

1. **Fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click **`File`** > **`Close Project`** to close the existing project dialog first).
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle  
   a. To set up the correct project structure **`Configure`** > **`Project Defaults`** > **`Project Structure`**  
   b. Under **`New...`** find the directory of the appropriate JDK version.
4. Click **`Import Project`**.
5. Find the **`build.gradle`** file and select it. Click **`OK`**.
6. Click **`Open as Project`**.
7. Click **`OK`** and accept the default settings.

### 2.3. Configure the coding style

In IntelliJ's IDEA we adopt [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html)
to set up IDEAâ€™s coding style to match ours.

> Optionally, you can follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html)
> to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems as you write code.

## 3. Design

<!-- {Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.} -->

### 3.1 Architecture

![Architecture](images/Architecture.png)  
**How the architecture components interact with each other**

Core program flow (`Main`) is managed by the Duke class.

`Commons` represents a collection of commonly used classes.

![Main Program Flow](images/mainProgramFlow.png)

The Duke class delegates work to the Ui class to handle user input.

User input is passed to the Parser class to parse the input as a command. Each command subclass handles its own execution.

These are the three main subcomponents that duke and command subclasses delegate work to:

- `Ui`: Handles user interactions such as receiving input and displaying output.
- `State`: Stores and updates application state.
- `Storage`: Reads and writes data to the hard disk in a NUSMods export link format.

### 3.2 Model package

The Model package is responsible for business logic - in particular, for dealing with any module related data. The design of these classes is based off the original [NUSMods type classes](https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods/blob/master/scrapers/nus-v2/src/types/modules.ts).

It consists of the following classes:

- `Day`: Represents a day in the timetable.
- `LessonType`: Represents the type of lesson.
- `Module`: Represents a module in NUS.
- `ModuleLoader`: Loads the module information from the NUSMods resource file.
- `RawLesson`: Represents a single block in a timetable representing one lesson slot. Properties are meant to be
  freely accessed but not modified.
- `SelectedModule`: Represents a module selected by the user that is to be added into his or her timetable.
- `SemesterData`: Semester data contains all the module information pertaining to a single semester.
- `Timetable`: Creates a timetable for the user with their selected modules and in their planning semester.

![Model Classes](images/model.png)

#### 3.2.1 Module Loader

Module loading is handled by the `ModuleLoader` class. This class contains logic to parse the data file stored at `src/main/resources/moduleFull.zip`. The data file is a ZIP file containing a JSON file. Zipping is used to minimize the application size. In exchange, the data file needs to be unzipped to read the module data, but this only happens once at the start of the application. JSON parsing in the `ModuleLoader` class is done using the Jackson Databind library.

#### 3.2.2 Timetable

The `Timetable` class handles the logic of formatting a timetable, given a set of lessons to be shown. To cater to a CLI environment, the timetable is always shown with time running vertically. One of the challenges in timetable formatting is that lessons may overlap, and the width of the timetable needs to be adjusted in such cases.

The sequence of steps to generate a timetable can be summarised as follows:

1. Calculate the earliest and latest class. This will determine the height of the timetable.
2. Check if any classes have overlapping timeslots. If so, generate a list of identation levels for the classes.
3. Create a buffer, a 2D array of Strings, to store our output.
4. Write the day labels and time labels to the buffer.
5. For each class, draw the bounding box into the buffer and write the class codes into the buffer.

### 3.3 Parser Component

![Parser Class](images/parserClass.png)  


The <code>Parser</code> component can:

- return the correct command type based on user input.

This component also consists of `DayParser` and `LessonTypeParser` to help parse their respective
day and lesson info into programme-understood values.

#### 3.3.1 How the feature is implemented

The main function of the `Parser` component is `parse` which returns the correct command type
based on the first word of the user input. It also consists of various helper functions for the different
`Commmand` classes to validate if the user input is correct.

#### 3.3.2 Why it is implemented this way

The `Parser` component should not know what is a valid command for the specific command type but instead
can assist in parsing the user input to do data validation. It only carries out basic data validation to 
check if the user input does not belong to any command type. This also makes it easier to add new commands 
in the future as the developer only needs to create a new command class and the parser checks for the new keyword.

#### 3.3.3 Alternatives considered
All invalid inputs handled by the `Parser` and only returns valid `Command` classes.
However, this will make the `Parser` class will be very long as it has to check for all invalid inputs for all commands.
Additionally, it will be difficult to implement as different commands have different parameters that they require.
Finally, it will also lead to tight coupling and decreased cohesion.

### 3.4 Command Component

![Command Abstract Class](images/commandClass.png)

The <code>Command</code> component can:
- execute based on the command type.  

The individual `Command` classes contains `public static final String` that specifies the keyword, usage and description of that command.
They may also consist of various possible error messages related to that command.

Below is a table of command subclasses and their respective command type. The different command types extends from the
Command class and are all in the command package. You may click the specific command under **Command Subclass** to view 
more information about that command.

| Command Word | Command Subclass                                      | Intended Outcome                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add`        | [`AddModuleCommand`](#341-addmodulecommand)           | Adds the user input module into their timetable.                   |
| `remove`     | [`RemoveModuleCommand`](#342-RemoveModuleCommand)     | Removes the user input module from their timetable.                |
| `list`       | [`ListCommand`](#3410-listcommand)                    | Display all the module and slot selected by user                   |
| `bye`        | [`ByeCommand`](#349-byecommand)                       | Exits the program.                                                 |
| `export`     | [`ExportCommand`](#3411-exportcommand)                | Creates a portable NUSMod link to create their timetable on NUSMod |
| `info`       | [`InfoCommand`](#347-infocommand)                     | Display all details about a module.                                |
| `help`       | [`HelpCommand`](#343-helpcommand)                     | Display all possible command words and their usage to user.        |
| `import`     | [`ImportCommand`](#3412-importcommand)                | Import user's timetable from a NUSMod share timetable link.        |
| `search`     | [`SearchModuleCommand`](#344-searchmodulecommand)     | Searches similar modules based on code, title, semester or level.  |
| `semester`   | [`SelectSemesterCommand`](#346-selectsemestercommand) | Selects the semester that the user want.                           |
| `select`     | [`SelectSlotCommand`](#345-selectslotcommand)         | Selects the time slot for the different lesson types.              |
| `timetable`  | [`TimetableCommand`](#348-timetablecommand)           | Views the user timetable with user's selected modules.             |

#### 3.4.1 AddModuleCommand

The <code>AddModuleCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and adds the user input module into
their timetable.

![AddModuleCommand Class](images/AddModuleCommandClass.png)

##### 3.4.1.1 How the feature is implemented
The `AddModuleCommand` class extends the `Command` class.
The constructor `AddModuleCommand()` parses the user `input` module code `.toUpperCase()` as the format to fetch an
instance of `module` from its class. Boolean `successful` field is used to flag successfully added modules in comparison
to instances where it is not possible to add the `module` as it already exists in the `state`'s `selectedModuleList`.
It overrides the `execute()` method from the `Command` class, and updates `successful` accordingly, which will later be
passed on to the overridden `getExecutionMessage()` which displays the result of data validation that new `selectedModule`
added are unique.

##### 3.4.1.2 Why it is implemented this way
In order to be able to be able to compare the new instance of `selectedModule` created of the module code the user wants to delete,
in the constructor against an instance of the module the user has previously added into the `selectedModuleList`, the `equals()`
method extended from super class `Object` has been overridden to return `true` for instances where `semester` and `module`
(specifically `moduleCode` attribute from the parent class) are the same, allowing us to validate and add the desired module.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![AddModuleCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddModuleCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

##### 3.4.1.3 Alternatives considered
Initially, data validation was being handled by the `Parser` class, however in the principles of avoiding tight coupling
and improving cohesion, it was moved back under the `AddModuleCommand` class.

#### 3.4.2 RemoveModuleCommand

The <code>RemoveModuleCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and deletes the user input module
from their timetable.

##### 3.4.2.1 How the feature is implemented
The `RemoveModuleCommand` class extends the `Command` class.
Similar to `AddModuleCommand` class, the constructor `RemoveModuleCommand()` parses the user `input` module code `.toUpperCase()` as the format to fetch an
instance of `module` from its class. Boolean `successful` field is used to flag successfully added modules in comparison
to instances where it is not possible to add the `module` as it already exists in the `state`'s `selectedModuleList`.
It overrides the `execute()` method from the `Command` class, and updates `successful` accordingly, which will later be
passed on to the overridden `getExecutionMessage()` which displays the result of data validation that the `selectedModule`
instance is only removed from the `selectedModuleList` if it exists.

##### 3.4.2.2 Why it is implemented this way
In order to be able to be able to compare the new instance of `selectedModule` created of the module code the user wants to delete,
in the constructor against an instance of the module the user has previously added into the `selectedModuleList`, the `equals()`
method extended from super class `Object` has been overridden to return `true` for instances where `semester` and `module`
(specifically `moduleCode` attribute from the parent class) are the same, allowing us to validate and remove the desired module.

##### 3.4.2.3 Alternatives considered
Once again, data validation was being handled by the `Parser` class, however in the principles of avoiding tight coupling
and improving cohesion, it was moved back under the `RemoveModuleCommand` class.

#### 3.4.3 HelpCommand

The <code>HelpCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and displays the help message.

##### 3.4.3.1 How the feature is implemented
The `HelpCommand` class extends the `Command` class
The `HelpCommand` class compiles the description of each command keyword and their usages by invoking `getDescription` 
and `getUsage` of the other command subclass.
Within `HelpCommand` there are other messages that help to make it more user-friendly and intuitive to read.
Among the message that `HelpCommand` contains, it has a link to the user guide that aim to direct user to the project repository,
where user are able to read about the various commands in further details.

##### 3.4.3.2 Why it is implemented this way
It is to encapsulate the process of getting useful information within one class, where the class only focuses on compiling
the information and formatting it in a way that makes most intuitive sense to the user.

##### 3.4.3.3 Alternatives considered
Each command class to print the messages sequentially, this creates unnecessary complexity when printing information as changing
the number of commands available will involve refactoring at multiple parts of the codebase.


#### 3.4.4 SearchModuleCommand
![SearchModuleCommand](images/SearchModuleCommand.png)

##### 3.4.4.1 How the feature is implemented
The <code>SearchModuleCommand</code> class extends the <code>Command</code> class.
It overrides the <code>execute()</code> method from the <code>Command</code> class.
The <code>execute()</code> method will search for the user input module primarily based on either module code or title,
with additional parameters of semester and level to narrow down the search results.

##### 3.4.4.2 Why it is implemented this way
User may or may not know the exact module code or title. As such, the user can search for the module based on optional
parameters such as semester or level. However, the user must input at least the module code or title before additional
parameters can be added in order to refine the search.

##### 3.4.4.3 Alternatives considered
We thought of implementing the search feature in a way that the required user for multiple inputs and displaying all the
different results after each input. However, we decided against it as it would be too tedious for the user to input
multiple times and the search process will be too long.

#### 3.4.5 SelectSlotCommand

The <code>SelectCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and selects the time slot for the different
lesson types.

#### 3.4.6 SelectSemesterCommand

The <code>SelectSemesterCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and selects the semester that the
user wish to plan for.


#### 3.4.7 InfoCommand

The <code>InfoCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and gets all the details of the module 
that the user wants.

![GetModuleCommand](images/GetModuleCommand.png)

<!-- TODO: update diagram -->

##### 3.4.7.1 How the feature is implemented
The <code>InfoCommand</code> class extends the <code>Command</code> class.
It overrides the <code>execute()</code> method from the <code>Command</code> class.
The <code>execute()</code> method will get all the module details from the user input module code.

##### 3.4.7.2 Why it is implemented this way
This function was implemented this way as it is the most intuitive way to get the module details. It also displays all
the different lesson types and their respective time slots. However, if the user is planning in a semester that the
module is not offered, the user will be notified that the module is not offered in the current semester and timings will
not be shown. This is to prevent the user from selecting a time slot that is not offered in the current semester, which
will reduce the chance of having an error if the user tries to select a time slot of the module that is not offered in
the current semester.

##### 3.4.7.3 Alternatives considered
We thought of displaying the full module details from the search results. However, we decided against it as it would be
too tedious for the user to search for the **exact module code** first before getting the details. The user may
not know the exact module code, which is not very user-friendly and takes up a lot of time just to get the module
details for 1 module.

#### 3.4.8 TimetableCommand
![TimetableCommand](images/TimetableCommandClass.png)

The <code>TimetableCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and displays the timetable of the current state's semester
selected modules.

##### 3.4.8.1 How the feature is implemented
The `execute` method will create a `List<Pair<Module,RawLesson>>` from the selected modules of the current semester and uses
the [Timetable](#322-timetable) class to display to the user the timetable of the currently selected semester.
`/show fancy` is to show the timetable with color while `/show simple` shows without color.

##### 3.4.8.2 Why it is implemented this way
To make use of the existing [Timetable](#322-timetable) class that has a nice format. This prevents the need 
to create duplicate code to fulfil similar needs as the timetable is needed by other components.

#### 3.4.9 ByeCommand
The <code>ByeCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and exits the program.

#### 3.4.10 ListCommand
The <code>ListCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and lists out all the currently
selected modules and lesson slots.

#### 3.4.11 ExportCommand
The <code>ExportCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and exports the current state
of the application, namely the selected modules and the respective selected lesson slots for all semesters and
outputs NUSMods links. 

#### 3.4.12 ImportCommand
The <code>ImportCommand</code> class extends from the <code>Command</code> class and imports a single semester
from a NUSMods link.

### 3.5 Utils Component

#### 3.5.1 UI Component

![UI Class](images/Ui.png)

The <code>UI</code> component can:
- read input from the user
- store and print out messages to the user

##### 3.5.1.1 Why it is implemented this way
To comply with the Model-View Controller Framework
To separate the internal representations and processing of information from the presentation and acceptance of
information from the user

##### 3.5.1.2 Alternative Considered
Each component to handle the presentation of information to the user

- Increase coupling between components
- Hard to define the sequence that information being presented to user

#### 3.5.2 Link Component

![Link Class](images/linkClass.png)

The <code>Link</code> component can:
- create a [NUSmod](https://nusmods.com/) link to be used in a browser
- Parse a NUSmod link to import modules into YAMOM

NUSMods export links are of the form:  
https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-SEMESTER_NUMBER/share?MODULE_INFO&MODULE_INFO  
The two useful segments are the SEMESTER_NUMBER and the MODULE_INFO.  

##### 3.5.2.1 Why is it implemented this way
To separate out the handling of NUSmod compatibility.

##### 3.5.2.2 Alternative Considered
To implement the handling of export in Storage class and import in Command class

- Increase coupling between components
- Decrease reusability of NUSmod link processing

#### 3.5.3 Storage Component

![Storage Class](images/storageClass.png)

The <code>Storage</code> component can:

- read from the hard disk NUSMods export links
- save to the hard disk

Different checks have been implemented to ensure that even
if the data file is modified in any way, it would not crash the programme.
Data for the saved state will be overwritten each run of the application to prevent
persistent data corruption and not require the user to manually edit the data file.

##### 3.5.3.1 Why it is implemented this way

To facilitate easy transfer of information from NUSMods to YAMOM. NUSMods is currently 
the most popular website used by NUS students to keep track of their timetable. This encourages
users to swap to using YAYMOM.

##### 3.5.3.2 Alternatives considered

Storing as <code>.json</code> file

- would have to implement another function for export/import function

## 4. Implementation

This section describes how key features of YAMOM are implemented in the latest release V1.0

### Storage feature

!["Opening saved state"](images/storageOpenPreviousState.png)  
When the application starts up, the storage openPreviousState function will be called
to load previous state

### Target user profile

<!-- {Describe the target user profile} -->

### Value proposition

<!-- {Describe the value proposition: what problem does it solve?} -->

## 5. Documentation

The following section describes how documentation for the project should be written. Note: documentation is all
written in [GitHub-Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## 6. Testing

The following section describes the testing methodologies followed in this project to ensure high-quality, bug-free
code as far as possible.

The more critical classes each has a test class which tests the various 
functions implemented in those respective classes.
